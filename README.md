# F1 Replay Viewer

Using real-world race data to build an immersive and interactive replay experience for Formula 1.  
This project is in very early development and not currently functional.

## Current Focus

- Learning and experimenting with the [OpenF1 API](https://openf1.org)  
- Understanding how to reliably collect, query, and structure race telemetry data  
- Building the foundation for accurate data playback  

## Next Steps

Once the data layer is stable, the next steps will be:

- Building out visuals and UI/UX  
- Creating a polished, interactive replay viewer that feels fluid and engaging
